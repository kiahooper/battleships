# Battleships

## Description

My take on the classic Battleship game. It has become a bit of a hybrid program, using both React components and seperate factory functions in the build.
This project was previously the last project before the final project in The Odin Project course (see 'Credits' #2), therefore I had been using React for the previous few projects and assumed this would be the same, but I fear the intention behind the project was not so.

Howeever, I built the factories using a test based approach - Implement a main game loop and the game could be played in the terminal. I then implemented an UI using React Components. 
I decided that this approach, while more complicated than it needs to be, ends up displaying use of a variety of skills in a single project. 

I have expanded on my computer player to use the 'Hunt' and 'Target' strategy, where the 'Hunt' mode uses probability density mapping and the 'Target' mode looks for ship lines when targeting. This is built following the blog post mentioned in 'Credits' #1 and is now a competent opponent. Place your ships carefully.
